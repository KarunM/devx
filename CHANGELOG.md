# Changelog

## 1.6.5

- `devx replace` one-shot edit (CLI) and `edit.replace` (MCP) with `--verify`: re-index, build and run relevant tests in one response
- No-session CLI: automatic per-repository session shared with the MCP server, automatic first-use indexing
- `devx read <name>` by bare symbol name, several targets per call; `devx search <query>` defaults to symbols with text fallback
- Compact agent output (`--format agent`, default for MCP; `format: json` opts out); compact build/test summaries with the full log in a file
- `devx test` runs standalone check scripts that print "N/M checks passed"
- Agent quick start in `devx --help` and in MCP tool descriptions

## 1.6.4

- `devx patch` supports text replacement (`ReplaceText`, alias `TextReplace`) with `--occurrence` and `--all`
- `devx test` accepts `--filter`, resolves directories inside .NET test projects, never labels .NET runs as pytest, always prints a result, and fails when a filter matches no tests

## 1.6.3

- C# types declared in the global namespace are now indexed

## 1.6.2

- Single-file builds no longer crash when indexing Python files
- Release workflow smoke-tests the published single-file binary on every target

## 1.6.1

- `read method` finds functions declared in top-level statements (for example `Program.cs`)
- `snapshot` accepts `--session`, `--agent` and `--task` before or after the file
